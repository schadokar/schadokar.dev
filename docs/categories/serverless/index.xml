      <description>Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider runs the server, and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity. - Wikipedia
In simple language, serverless means pay only for what you use. You might think there is already a Pay-as-you-go model provided by the cloud providers.</description>
