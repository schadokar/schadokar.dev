Photo by Markus Spiske onÂ I know these questions are obvious once you read the title.

      <title>Are Smart Contract and Chaincode the Same in Hyperledger Fabric</title>

      <description>Often Hyperledger Fabric users use the terms smart contract and chaincode interchangeably. Lets first understand what a smart contract is:
 A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible.â€Šâ€”â€ŠWikipedia
 Let&#39;s deduce this in simple languageâ€Šâ€”â€Ša contract can execute on its own if it satisfies the terms of the contract without any interference from a third party.</description>
