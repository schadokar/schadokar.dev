      <description>A string value is a sequence of bytes.
Using the Comparison operators == equal != not equal &amp;lt; less &amp;lt;= less or equal &amp;gt; greater &amp;gt;= greater or equal To check if strings are equal or not, you can use == or !=.
package main import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; ) func main() { str1 := &amp;#34;golang&amp;#34; str2 := &amp;#34;gopher&amp;#34; fmt.Println(str1 == str2) fmt.Println(str1 != str2) } Output
false true To check the Lexicographic Order of 2 strings, you can use &amp;lt;, &amp;lt;=, &amp;gt;, &amp;gt;=.</description>

      <description>When you start a project which interacts with the outer world, it requires data exchange. To make a project successful this interaction must be simple and efficient.
What is Data Exchange?  Data exchange is the process of taking data structured under a source schema and transforming it into data structured under a target schema, so that the target data is an accurate representation of the source data. - Wikipedia</description>

      <description>Photo by Moja Msanii on Unsplash When it comes to creating a production-grade application, using the environment variable in the application is de facto.
Why should we use the environment variable? Suppose you have an application with many features and each feature need to access the Database. You configured all the DB information like DBURL, DBNAME, USERNAME and PASSWORD in each feature.
There are a few major disadvantages to this approach, there can be many.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wonder why in the world of GUI, CLI still exist? You’ll better understand it when you build one of your own.
When you learn golang then it is very often that you’ll come across that ‘golang is great to build cli tools’. This fascinated me too. So, I tried to get my hands dirty and found a few tutorials of creating a cli but most of all are not basic.</description>

      <description>The main purpose of this tutorial to get hands-on experience in Golang. When I was learning Golang, I realized there are very few tutorials and articles out there which give you a complete end to end hands-on experience.
This is the GitHub link for the complete code.
 In this tutorial, we will build a todo app in which the server will be in Golang, the database will be MongoDB, and the frontend will be in React.</description>
