      <description>In this tutorial, we will create a to-do list app in reactjs. We will use browser local storage to save the tasks, which will keep the tasks even after we close the browser. In the end, we will host this application on Github pages.
Pre-requisites  Nodejs Code editor (I am using VS Code) Github Account   React Application We are going to use create-react-app as our base application.</description>

Data structures and Algorithms are the key skills for a software developer. Recently when I was preparing for a job change, learning sorting algorithms was not smooth.
The theory is simple and straight but its implementation is just the opposite.
 I think concept and implementation are inversely proportional. ðŸ¤”
 There are many sorting algorithms like bubblesort, mergesort, quicksort etc. Among all, quicksort is one of the most popular sorting algorithms.</description>

Hyperledger Fabric is all about permissions. These permissions are provided in the form of certificates and keys. In broad term, it is known as Identities.
When an application interacts with the Hyperledger Fabric Network, it uses this identity to authenticate itself. Fabric network validates the identity and authorizes the application to interact.
In short, identities are very important and if you don&#39;t save them properly, then it may turn into a headache.</description>

      <description>Photo by Moja Msanii on Unsplash When it comes to creating a production-grade application, using the environment variable in the application is de facto.
Why should we use the environment variable? Suppose you have an application with many features and each feature need to access the Database. You configured all the DB information like DBURL, DBNAME, USERNAME and PASSWORD in each feature.
There are a few major disadvantages to this approach, there can be many.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wonder why in the world of GUI, CLI still exist? Youâ€™ll better understand it when you build one of your own.
When you learn golang then it is very often that youâ€™ll come across that â€˜golang is great to build cli toolsâ€™. This fascinated me too. So, I tried to get my hands dirty and found a few tutorials of creating a cli but most of all are not basic.</description>

      <description>When I started learning Hyperledger Fabric, installing it is really a pain in a neck and it turned miserable as I was using Windows.
The purpose of this article to put all the instructions at one place to set up the Hyperledger Fabric network irrespective of the fact if youâ€™re using Windows or Linux.
My apologies for macOS readers, instructions for macOS is not included as I donâ€™t have one.</description>

You can clone the project using this GitHub link.
Thanks to the people whoâ€™s article and courses helped a lot:
Brandon Morelli For HTML and CSS ( Build a Weather Website )
Stephen Grider For Ethereum and Docker course on Udemy.
 Before beginning lets understand what weâ€™re going to build and how the structure of our Dapp will look like.</description>
