      <description>Have you ever wonder why in the world of GUI, CLI still exist? You’ll better understand it when you build one of your own.
When you learn golang then it is very often that you’ll come across that ‘golang is great to build cli tools’. This fascinated me too. So, I tried to get my hands dirty and found a few tutorials of creating a cli but most of all are not basic.</description>

      <description>The main purpose of this tutorial to get hands-on experience in Golang. When I was learning Golang, I realized there are very few tutorials and articles out there which give you a complete end to end hands-on experience.
This is the GitHub link for the complete code.
 In this tutorial, we will build a todo app in which the server will be in Golang, the database will be MongoDB, and the frontend will be in React.</description>
