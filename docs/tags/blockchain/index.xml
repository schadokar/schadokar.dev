 You can find the complete code in the github.
 Without wasting any time let&#39;s build it.

      <description>What is decentralized internet? Why we need the decentralized Internet?
I know these questions are obvious once you read the title.
First, understand the current situation of the internet and then we’ll explore the possibilities of the Catalyst Network.
What is the current situation of the Internet? A global network connecting millions of computers is the Internet. The Internet is decentralized by design. But today’s situation is far from this. The tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook dominating the internet.</description>

      <title>Are Smart Contract and Chaincode the Same in Hyperledger Fabric</title>

      <description>Often Hyperledger Fabric users use the terms smart contract and chaincode interchangeably. Lets first understand what a smart contract is:
 A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible. — Wikipedia
 Let&#39;s deduce this in simple language — a contract can execute on its own if it satisfies the terms of the contract without any interference from a third party.</description>

      <description>When I started learning Hyperledger Fabric, installing it is really a pain in a neck and it turned miserable as I was using Windows.
The purpose of this article to put all the instructions at one place to set up the Hyperledger Fabric network irrespective of the fact if you’re using Windows or Linux.
My apologies for macOS readers, instructions for macOS is not included as I don’t have one.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial, we’ll create an Ethereum Dapp and will run its different components in a separate docker container.
You can clone the project using this GitHub link.
Thanks to the people who’s article and courses helped a lot:
Brandon Morelli For HTML and CSS ( Build a Weather Website )
Stephen Grider For Ethereum and Docker course on Udemy.
 Before beginning lets understand what we’re going to build and how the structure of our Dapp will look like.</description>
