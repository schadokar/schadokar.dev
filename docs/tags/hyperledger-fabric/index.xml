Hyperledger Fabric is all about permissions. These permissions are provided in the form of certificates and keys. In broad term, it is known as Identities.
When an application interacts with the Hyperledger Fabric Network, it uses this identity to authenticate itself. Fabric network validates the identity and authorizes the application to interact.
In short, identities are very important and if you don&#39;t save them properly, then it may turn into a headache.</description>

      <description>Often Hyperledger Fabric users use the terms smart contract and chaincode interchangeably. Lets first understand what a smart contract is:
 A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible. — Wikipedia
 Let&#39;s deduce this in simple language — a contract can execute on its own if it satisfies the terms of the contract without any interference from a third party.</description>

      <description>When I started learning Hyperledger Fabric, installing it is really a pain in a neck and it turned miserable as I was using Windows.
The purpose of this article to put all the instructions at one place to set up the Hyperledger Fabric network irrespective of the fact if you’re using Windows or Linux.
My apologies for macOS readers, instructions for macOS is not included as I don’t have one.</description>
