Hyperledger Fabric is all about permissions. These permissions are provided in the form of certificates and keys. In broad term, it is known as Identities.
When an application interacts with the Hyperledger Fabric Network, it uses this identity to authenticate itself. Fabric network validates the identity and authorizes the application to interact.
In short, identities are very important and if you don&#39;t save them properly, then it may turn into a headache.</description>

      <title>Use Environment Variable in your next Golang Project</title>

      <description>Photo by Moja Msanii on Unsplash When it comes to creating a production-grade application, using the environment variable in the application is de facto.
Why should we use the environment variable? Suppose you have an application with many features and each feature need to access the Database. You configured all the DB information like DBURL, DBNAME, USERNAME and PASSWORD in each feature.
There are a few major disadvantages to this approach, there can be many.</description>

      <description>Photo by Radek Grzybowski on Unsplash In this tutorial, we&#39;ll create a simple single-page etherscan in reactjs. For the clean UI, we are going to use the amazing semantic-ui-react which is the official react integration for semantic-ui.
 You can find the complete code in the github.
 Without wasting any time let&#39;s build it.

      <description>Have you ever wonder why in the world of GUI, CLI still exist? You’ll better understand it when you build one of your own.
When you learn golang then it is very often that you’ll come across that ‘golang is great to build cli tools’. This fascinated me too. So, I tried to get my hands dirty and found a few tutorials of creating a cli but most of all are not basic.</description>

      <description>What is decentralized internet? Why we need the decentralized Internet?
I know these questions are obvious once you read the title.
First, understand the current situation of the internet and then we’ll explore the possibilities of the Catalyst Network.
What is the current situation of the Internet? A global network connecting millions of computers is the Internet. The Internet is decentralized by design. But today’s situation is far from this. The tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook dominating the internet.</description>

      <description>The main purpose of this tutorial to get hands-on experience in Golang. When I was learning Golang, I realized there are very few tutorials and articles out there which give you a complete end to end hands-on experience.
This is the GitHub link for the complete code.
 In this tutorial, we will build a todo app in which the server will be in Golang, the database will be MongoDB, and the frontend will be in React.</description>

      <title>Are Smart Contract and Chaincode the Same in Hyperledger Fabric</title>
      <link>https://schadokar.dev/posts/are-smart-contract-and-chaincode-the-same-in-hyperledger-fabric/</link>

      <description>Often Hyperledger Fabric users use the terms smart contract and chaincode interchangeably. Lets first understand what a smart contract is:
 A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible. — Wikipedia
 Let&#39;s deduce this in simple language — a contract can execute on its own if it satisfies the terms of the contract without any interference from a third party.</description>

      <description>When I started learning Hyperledger Fabric, installing it is really a pain in a neck and it turned miserable as I was using Windows.
The purpose of this article to put all the instructions at one place to set up the Hyperledger Fabric network irrespective of the fact if you’re using Windows or Linux.
My apologies for macOS readers, instructions for macOS is not included as I don’t have one.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial, we’ll create an Ethereum Dapp and will run its different components in a separate docker container.
You can clone the project using this GitHub link.
Thanks to the people who’s article and courses helped a lot:
Brandon Morelli For HTML and CSS ( Build a Weather Website )
Stephen Grider For Ethereum and Docker course on Udemy.
 Before beginning lets understand what we’re going to build and how the structure of our Dapp will look like.</description>
