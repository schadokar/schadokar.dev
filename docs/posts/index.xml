      <description>In this tutorial, we are going to create a golang serverless application and deploy it to the AWS cloud.
Prerequisites  Serverless Installed AWS account Connect AWS account to serverless  All these are covered in detail in the last tutorial.
Getting Started Create a new directory hello-go-serverless.
Open the terminal inside the project.
Run the below command to initiate the serverless application using aws-go-mod template.
This will create a basic scaffolding of the serverless project.</description>

      <description>Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider runs the server, and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity. - Wikipedia
In simple language, serverless means pay only for what you use. You might think there is already a Pay-as-you-go model provided by the cloud providers.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial, we will learn how to secure the APIs using the JWT authentication in Golang.
In any application, APIs are the bridge between two services. These services can be anything, like a backend service or a frontend service.
To secure the application, bridge security is important.
JWT is a JSON web token. In which, a token is generated by 1 service and shared with another service. Whenever the 2nd service make a request to the 1st service, it will send the token with the request.</description>

 A command-line interface (CLI) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. - Wikipedia
 Objective of the color cli The objective of the colorcli is to return the name of the hexcode of the color. If the hexcode doesn&#39;t exist then colorcli can add the color.</description>

      <description>When you start a project which interacts with the outer world, it requires data exchange. To make a project successful this interaction must be simple and efficient.
What is Data Exchange?  Data exchange is the process of taking data structured under a source schema and transforming it into data structured under a target schema, so that the target data is an accurate representation of the source data. - Wikipedia</description>

Data structures and Algorithms are the key skills for a software developer. Recently when I was preparing for a job change, learning sorting algorithms was not smooth.
The theory is simple and straight but its implementation is just the opposite.
 I think concept and implementation are inversely proportional. ðŸ¤”
 There are many sorting algorithms like bubblesort, mergesort, quicksort etc. Among all, quicksort is one of the most popular sorting algorithms.</description>

Hyperledger Fabric is all about permissions. These permissions are provided in the form of certificates and keys. In broad term, it is known as Identities.
When an application interacts with the Hyperledger Fabric Network, it uses this identity to authenticate itself. Fabric network validates the identity and authorizes the application to interact.
In short, identities are very important and if you don&#39;t save them properly, then it may turn into a headache.</description>

      <description>Photo by Moja Msanii on Unsplash When it comes to creating a production-grade application, using the environment variable in the application is de facto.
Why should we use the environment variable? Suppose you have an application with many features and each feature need to access the Database. You configured all the DB information like DBURL, DBNAME, USERNAME and PASSWORD in each feature.
There are a few major disadvantages to this approach, there can be many.</description>

Have you ever wonder why in the world of GUI, CLI still exist? Youâ€™ll better understand it when you build one of your own.
When you learn golang then it is very often that youâ€™ll come across that â€˜golang is great to build cli toolsâ€™. This fascinated me too. So, I tried to get my hands dirty and found a few tutorials of creating a cli but most of all are not basic.</description>

      <title>Are Smart Contract and Chaincode the Same in Hyperledger Fabric</title>

      <guid>/posts/are-smart-contract-and-chaincode-the-same-in-hyperledger-fabric/</guid>
      <description>Often Hyperledger Fabric users use the terms smart contract and chaincode interchangeably. Lets first understand what a smart contract is:
 A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible.â€Šâ€”â€ŠWikipedia
 Let&#39;s deduce this in simple languageâ€Šâ€”â€Ša contract can execute on its own if it satisfies the terms of the contract without any interference from a third party.</description>
