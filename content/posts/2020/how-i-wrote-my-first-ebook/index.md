Recently, I wrote my first eBook. Yes, I finally wrote it.  
It was on my list for a long time and when it finally completed, I love to share the experience with everyone.

I wrote the eBook on Hyperledger Composer Blockchain tool.

# Motivation ðŸš€

I am writing articles and tutorials since late 2018. By now I am quite comfortable on how to write an article or a tutorial. What tools should I use or the approach.
But when it comes to the book writing, the arena is quite different. My motivation was the curiosity, how authors write books? What is their thought process? What tools they use? And of course how it feels to write a book. ðŸ˜„

I am a Software Engineer and I am working on Blockchain since 2018. I learnt different blockchains like Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric. I used many tools like [truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and [hyperledger composer](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/).
I had a few options to write like **Ethereum** or **Hyperledger Fabric**. Since, it was my first eBook, these topics were not ideal for me. Because, these topics requires a lot of time and efforts. So, I picked the simple one, Hyperledger Composer.

# First Hurdle

Which tool or editor should I use to write the book?  
Should I write in MS Word, Google Docs or use something else?  

I read lots of articles on **What are good tools available for book writing?**. I tried many tools but I wasn't happy with any of them. I wasted a lot of time on finding the perfect tool.  
In the end, I realize that editors ease your writing and managing the book but what matter is the content. So, I stopped searching for editors and went to basic.

## Basic
In the end, I used my favorite code editor. Yes, **VS Code** ðŸ¥°.
After, spending days of finding on Internet, not a single article suggested that *we don't require any specific tool or editor to write a technical book, VS Code or Atom is more than enough.*  

I wrote the complete eBook on **VS Code** in my favorite markdown format. To ease my writing, I used a couple of markdown plugins like **Markdown All in One** and **Markdown Preview Enhanced**.  
The first plugin help you writing markdown while the second helps in preview and how the markdown will look and behave after converting into HTML or other format. The **Markdown All in One** also has a preview but **Markdown Preview Enhanced** has multiple themes and options to export the markdown file in HTML, PDF and other reading formats like ePub or mobi. The other formats requires the **Pandoc** installed in the machine.  

> I am a Windows User. For Mac Users I found there are many great editors available [bear](https://bear.app/), [ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) and many other.

Recently, I found there are many markdown editors available on **Windows** and **MacOS** which you can use for book writing. Like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Typora](https://typora.io/), [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), [SimpleNote](https://simplenote.com/).
