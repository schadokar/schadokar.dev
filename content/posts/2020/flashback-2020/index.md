Finally, an another year ends with lots of memory and lost days. Unlike many years, this year was an exception.

A deadly virus come out of China, may be one of the deadliest of the century. With this single event all the perceptions of life has changed.

Not going in that. Lets starts.

Like all the new year, in 2020 I also made few resolutions. Gym, join some salsa classes, have at least 4-5 trips, dubai expo 2020, reunion with few friends, 50 articles and a few more which I don't remember.

It starts really well. In the beginning, I felt like this is the year when I will finally adhere to my resolutions.

But due to wuhan virus(aka corona) all the parameters turn 180 degree.
